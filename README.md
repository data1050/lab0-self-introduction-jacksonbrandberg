Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hey!! My name is Jackson Brandberg. I'm a first year Data Science Master's student. I'm from Johns Creek, Georgia (just outside of Atlanta). I just finished my undergrad at University of Virginia where I studied Global Sustainability and Portuguese. My favorite type of food is Korean BBQ and I really enjoy baking different kinds of sweets when I have spare time.
